Description: Functions for the gene-based association tests that integrate both common and rare genetic variation from promoter and enhancers for each gene, along with the knockoff-enhanced tests. The GeneScan3DKnock has two steps: Step 1. Knockoff generation using function GeneScan3D.KnockoffGeneration() and Step 2. Knockoff filter using function GeneScan3DKnock().
