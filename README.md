# GeneScan3DKnock 
This is an R package for performing improved gene-based testing by integrating long-range chromatin interactions and knockoff statistics.

## Description
The package contain functions for the gene-based association tests (GeneScan3D) that integrate both common and rare genetic variation from promoter and enhancers for each gene, along with the knockoff-enhanced tests. The GeneScan3DKnock has two steps: Step 1. Knockoff generation using function GeneScan3D.KnockoffGeneration() and Step 2. Knockoff filter using function GeneScan3DKnock(), after obtaining the original and knockoff p-values for each gene. 

To deal with the case-control imbalance issue for binary traits, we apply the Saddlepoint approximation (SPA) of the gene-based tests to avoid the inflation of Type I error rate. 

Besides, we also optimize the knockoff generations for GeneScan3DKnock using Shrinkage leveraging (SL) algorithm. After the optimization, knockoffs generation of whole-genome UK biobank genotypes only take 11 CPU hours for 1,000 computational cores.

## Version history
The current version is Version 0.3.

Version 0.3 (Resampling option in functions can be false. Don't need to conduct resampling-based moment-matching when the sample size is large, especially for UK biobank-scale data; Add W.threshold in the GeneScan3DKnock() function; Apply SPA gene-based test for binary traits, to deal with imbalance case-control issues; The knockoff generations are optimized using shrinkage leveraging algorithm.)
